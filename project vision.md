Project Vision:

1.	Executive Summary

This project vision document was created to assist in communicating ideas between stakeholders and team members. It serves as a reference tool, a point of focus that can be revisited frequently to ensure that the project is progressing adequately towards the stated goal. 

The goal of the project is to create a multi-directional 2D space-shooter game, designed to be fast-paced and action-packed. The goal of the game is to eliminate the enemy ships that approach the player from all directions. The player will pilot a spaceship using keyboard controls. 

The game will be designed using Unity and C#, designed to be run on Windows platforms.

2.	Problem: 

The client’s demands include a space-shooter game, with responsive controls, high-intensity action and endless waves of enemies. The client sees a potential market for this type of game, especially on the PC platform which allows for keyboard controls. Client expects the final product to be polished, responsive and enjoyable, as well as appropriate for all ages.

The development team is confident in their ability to successfully complete this project according to the requirements, considering the resources available to them. The project will serve as a learning tool for the development team members, improving collaboration, communication and teamwork skills, as well as challenging their technical ability. 

3.	Initial architecture: 

High-level technical architecture being followed, and, if appropriate, any alternatives considered and why they weren’t chosen. 

The game engine chosen is Unity. It was chosen for its powerful features, such as wide range of asset support, ease of use, free license model option, and support for high-fidelity sprites and animations. 
	
The programming language that will be used in conjunction with the game engine is C#. This is the main programming language using by Unity. The development team is familiar with this language, and they are confident in their ability to write well-optimized code that performs well on many different systems.

The target platform is PC, specifically Windows platform. This is as per the client’s demands. It also combines well with Unity to make a game that runs well on weaker machines too. The development team is comfortable with the Windows platform.

The version control system to be used is Git, using Github. This will be used as a collaboration tool for source code control, bug tracking, task management and as a source of backup for the code. 


4.	Scope/initial requirements: 

The following scope serves as a guide on what features the game will have. As far as possible, the scope must be adhered to, to prevent feature creep and project delay.

The client has asked for the following features to be implemented in the game. This is a list of must-have features:

•	The game must have responsive controls 
•	The game must have an arena within which the player will reside
•	The player is confined to the arena boundaries
•	There is an increasing number of enemies attacking the player
•	As the game progresses, the number of enemies attacking the player increases
•	The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible
•	Player can damage enemies, enemies can damage player
•	There should be a HUD showing the player health, score
•	Enemies have a health indicator bar
•	Visual indication to show damage to player or enemies
•	The game must have 3-5 enemy types
•	The player must have 2-4 ship choices
•	The game must have a start-up interface that allows player to choose ships, choose difficulty, see high scores
•	The game must have an appropriate game over screen 
•	The game must have background and effects sounds


There are also some nice-to-have features that the client has envisioned. These features can be worked on once the main features have been sufficiently completed and tested. 

•	Enemy ‘boss’ type ships that appear occasionally
•	Power-ups that the player can get to improve their ship speed, projectile capacity, increased damage, invulnerability, etc. 
•	Two-player mode that allows two players to play against the AI at the same time, on the same machine


5.	Cost estimation & Funding strategy:

The project will require about ~50 hours of work from each team member. Team members are responsible for dedicating their time towards the project voluntarily. As far as possible, the project must utilize free resources, such as the game engine, sprites, sounds, bitmaps, etc. 

All team members have voluntarily accepted to take on the work in the project. There will be no monetary compensation for any work done. There will be no external funding for the project.  

6.	Release plan:

Iteration 1 
Start data – 20/04/2019
Expected date of completion – 04/05/2019
Duration – 14 days
Project state at this iteration:

•	Skeletal project framework completed
•	Base functionality of game achieved
•	Game ‘arena’ completed, player is limited to the arena bounds
•	Player movement functionality completed
•	Player ship can shoot projectiles s
•	Collision checks added to see if player collides with game objects
•	Basic AI added for testing purposes
•	Can be playtested to ensure it meets basic game requirements

Iteration 1 can be presented to the client to see that it matches their vision for the game, in terms of the base functionality and the gameplay style. Any input from the client will be considered in iteration 2. 


Iteration 2

Start date – 05/05/2019
Expected date of completion – 19/05/2019
Duration – 14 days
Changes in this iteration:

•	Player ship movement physics added, to allow for ‘inertial’ movement
•	Enemy AI improved, they can now avoid objects in the game world
•	Player health and score functionality added
•	Heads-up display (HUD) added to show player health and score
•	Camera controls added, camera now tracks player around the game world (i.e. player ship remains centred on screen while the game world moves)
•	Add game state check, so that the game ends when the player loses all health
•	Add difficulty levels to the game (Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane) 
•	Game must be playtested to see if there are any bugs that can be fixed

Iteration 2 will give the client a better idea of what the final game will look like. This iteration improves on the physics, AI, and game state functionality. Any recommendations from client must be considered for iteration 3.


Iteration 3 

Start date – 20/05/2019
Expected date of completion – 01/06/2019
Duration – 10 days

Changes in this iteration:

•	Player and enemy model sprites added
•	Game background added 
•	Projectile sprites added, can be animated if needed
•	Background music added 
•	Sound effects added for projectiles, hits, misses, collisions, game over screen, etc. 
•	Different player ships and enemy ship models added 
•	Allow player to select their ship type at the start of the game 
•	Enemy ship type changes randomly (a new enemy ship can be any of the ship types, chosen randomly)
•	Enemy ships become faster, more numerous on higher difficulties
•	Playtest the game, by all team members and if possible, two non-involved individuals to ensure 

Iteration 3 is almost identical to the final product. At this stage, the game is polished to include secondary functionality such as better visuals, sounds, ship choices, etc. This iteration will be presented to the client to see if there are any last-minute changes that the client would like to make. 

Final release

Expected date – 04/06/2019

The final release of the game. At this stage, most of the bugs have been found and fixed. The game has been playtested to ensure that it meets the functionality and playability requirements as defined above. The final product is presented to the client. 

7.	Risks:

Risk	Probability	Impact	Plan
Lack of contribution 	Medium	High	Talk to team member, talk to tutor
Team disagreement	Medium	Medium	Analyse decision alternatives
Missing deadlines	High	High	Identify cause, shift future deadlines, start early
Unforeseen issues	Medium	High	Hold emergency team meeting to identify cause, plan solution
Loss of data	Low	High	Have several backups, on-site and off-site

                 The above table shows, at a glance, the risks faced by the project. 

Potential risks identified:
1)	Lack of contribution from team members
Mitigation strategy: Talk to team member to get them back on track. If they don’t respond, speak to tutor about it. All team members must endeavour to contribute as much as they can.

2)	Team disagreements on project direction
Mitigation strategy: Resolve team disagreements by analysing the alternatives and voting on a decision. All team members must follow the team vision for optimum success. 

3)	Missing iteration deadlines 
Mitigation strategy: Identify cause of delay, apply appropriate fixes to reduce chance of future delays. Change future deadlines as appropriate. 

4)	Unforeseen issues
Mitigation strategy: Identify source of the problem, to prevent the project from jeopardy. Hold emergency team meeting if necessary to resolve the issue.

5)	Loss/corruption of data:
Mitigation strategy: Have several onsite and remote backups of project data. All team members must have current copies of all project data, stored both on their PCs and on cloud storage locations. All work done using version control software such as Git (Github), therefore it is backed up on remote repository as well.

8.	Assumptions:
A list of key assumptions and decisions (if applicable).
-	User of the game has past experience with games.
-	No need for a tutorial stage in the game.
-	All team members have their own PCs, internet connections, basic experience with Github, C# programming, Slack, Discord, Google Drive and Windows. 
-	Team members complete the tasks that they accept. 
-	All team members show up to the weekly meetings on campus. 
-	All team members have an understanding of the project goal.


9.	Software development process:
		
Project will follow Agile development principles, using frequent, short iterations that delivers a product early to the client, to get their input. Collaborative, daily teamwork will be a focus of the project. Team members must work on the project on a frequent basis and communicate their thoughts and issues with other team members. The weekly face-to-face meetings are an important part of this development methodology. 

10.	Other project details (where applicable):
